# shell-scripts
A collection of my shell scripts. Most of these are POSIX shell scripts and all of these are licensed under the [Unlicense](LICENSE) unless otherwise specified.
# Common Dependencies
The following scripts assume you are using the GNU Coreutils and have not been tested on non-linux machines

You will also want the following if you wish to use (some of) the scripts without modification:
* [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* [xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) (As a terminal)
* [vim](https://www.vim.org/) (As a text editor)
# Usage
Using the scripts is easy, run the following commands:
```
chmod +x /path/to/script (if needed)
./path/to/script
```
or alternatively:
```
sh /path/to/script (replace sh with bash if needed)
```
If you would like to use them as you would commands, add the folder containing your scripts to your path variable or move them to a folder within your path variable
